## Some basic indications

- You're supposed to make the bridges with 2 to 3 points in a curve
- You can move the handles as much as you want to tweak the shape
- There's a linked duplicate, with the "Collider" tick on, and that's the one you should use for game engine colissions.
- The project comes with a basic Trimsheet, you can make your own if you want to, based on that, to avoid re-mapping the base mesh objects.
- You can link the "BridgeGenerator" Collection to any scene, and library override the splines to edit it seamlessly in any scene, no need to append everything into a scene.
